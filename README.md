#Things to note

There are a few bugs and if you upload a large song it might run very slowly on the website (colab should take 10 seconds maximum). Also if your song sounds weird that is because I have not full implemented rests and tempo. Unforunatley for now there will be no rests and you have to set the tempo youself by pressing the tempo button under the actions menu (it sort of looks like this '>>' and its the first button). Well thats all enjoy making random songs in a random program by a random geometry dash person...?
